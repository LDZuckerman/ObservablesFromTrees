NOTE: this is an ongoing project and is still under development.

## Motivation

To understand the evolutionary processes driving galaxy formation, we must be able to make efficient comparisons between large-scale survey data and state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy simulations. Rapid mapping between merger histories and observable galaxy properties will take us a long way towards this goal. 

## Approach

Merger histories are encoded intuitively as graph-like structure, and graph nueral networks have been shown to work well for predicting non-observable properties like galaxy mass [[1]](#1). In this project I extend these methods to predict observables directly.
